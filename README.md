# Transformers for Reinforcement Learning

This repo summarizes literature and additional online resources on transformers for reinforcement learning. Though we are trying our best to include all relevant works, it's possible that we might have missed your work. Please feel free to create an issue if you want your work to be added.

## Papers

### Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling

**NeurIPS'21** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01345) [[Code]](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer)
A seminal work that proposed a supervised learning framework based on transformers for sequential decision making tasks. It tackles RL as a sequence generation task. Given a pre-collected sequence decision making dataset, the Decision Transformer (DT) is trained to generated the action sequence that can lead to the expected return-to-go, which is used as the input to the transformer model.

### Offline Reinforcement Learning as One Big Sequence Modeling Problem

**NeurIPS'21** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02039) [[Code]](https://github.com/JannerM/trajectory-transformer)
This is another seminal work on applying transformers to RL and it was concurrent to Decision Transformer. The authors proposed Trajectory Transformer (TT) that combines transformers and beam search as a model-based approach for offline RL.

### Generalized Decision Transformer for Offline Hindsight Information Matching

**ICLR'22** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10364) [[Code]](https://github.com/frt03/generalized_dt)
The paper derived a RL problem formulation called Hindsight Information Matching (HIM) from many recently proposed RL algorithms that use future trajectory information to accelerate the learning of a conditional policy. The authors discussed three HIM variations including Generalized DT, Categorical DT, and Bi-Directional DT.

### Online Decision Transformer

**ICML'22** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05607) [[Code]](https://github.com/frt03/generalized_dt)
This is another seminal work on applying transformers to RL and it was concurrent to Decision Transformer. The authors proposed Trajectory Transformer (TT) that combines transformers and beam search as a model-based approach for offline RL.
