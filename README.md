# Awesome Transformers for Reinforcement Learning  

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repo tracks literature and additional online resources on transformers for reinforcement learning. We provide a short summary of each paper. Though we have tried our best to include all relevant works, it's possible that we might have missed your work. Please feel free to create an issue if you want your work to be added.

While we were preparing this repo, we noticed the [Awesome-Decision-Transformer](https://github.com/opendilab/awesome-decision-transformer) repo that also covers decision transformer literature. Awesome-Reinforcement-Learning does not provide paper summaries but lists the experiment environment used in each paper. We believe both repos are helpful for beginners to get started on Transformers for RL. If you find these resources to be useful, please follow and star both repos!

### Stabilizing Transformers for Reinforcement Learning

**ICML'20** [[Paper]](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/parisotto20a/parisotto20a.pdf)  

One of the first works succssfully applying transformers in the RL settings. This work aims to replace LSTM used in online RL with Transformers. The authors observed that training large-scale transformers in RL settings is unstable. Thus they proposed the Gate Transformer-XL architecture and showed that the novel architecture outperformed LSTMs in the DMLab-30 benchmark with a good training stability.  

--------

### Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling

**NeurIPS'21** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01345) [[Code]](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer)  
A seminal work that proposed a supervised learning framework based on transformers for sequential decision making tasks. It tackles RL as a sequence generation task. Given a pre-collected sequence decision making dataset, the Decision Transformer (DT) is trained to generated the action sequence that can lead to the expected return-to-go, which is used as the input to the transformer model.  

--------

### Offline Reinforcement Learning as One Big Sequence Modeling Problem

**NeurIPS'21** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02039) [[Code]](https://github.com/JannerM/trajectory-transformer)  
This is another seminal work on applying transformers to RL and it was concurrent to Decision Transformer. The authors proposed Trajectory Transformer (TT) that combines transformers and beam search as a model-based approach for offline RL.

### Efficient Transformers in Reinforcement Learning using Actor-Learner Distillation

**ICLR'21** [[Paper]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uR9LaO_QxF)

### Generalized Decision Transformer for Offline Hindsight Information Matching

**ICLR'22** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10364) [[Code]](https://github.com/frt03/generalized_dt)  
The paper derived a RL problem formulation called Hindsight Information Matching (HIM) from many recently proposed RL algorithms that use future trajectory information to accelerate the learning of a conditional policy. The authors discussed three HIM variations including Generalized DT, Categorical DT, and Bi-Directional DT.

### RvS: what is essential for offline RL via supervised learning?

**ICLR'22** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10751.pdf) [[Code]](https://github.com/scottemmons/rvs)  

DT solves reinforcement learning through supervised learning. It was hypothesized that the large model capacity of transformers could lead to better policies. The authors of this paper challenged the hypothesis and showed that a simple two-layer feedforward MLP led to similar performance with transformer-based methods. The findings of this paper imply that current designs of transformer-based reinforcement learning algorithms may not fully leverage the potential advantages of transformers.

**ICML'22** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13326)  

This work combines online RL and offline SL. The online phase is used for both RL training and data collection. In the offline phase, only successful trajectories are used for SL. The authors show that this approach performs well in sparse-reward settings. The authors tested DT for the SL phase and found that it was brittle and performed worse than a simple BC. This result show that the DT training stability requires more research.

--------

### Q-learning Decision Transformer: Leveraging Dynamic Programming for Conditional Sequence Modelling in Offline RL

**arXiv** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11251)  

The original DT completely requires on supervised learning to learn a value-conditioned behavior policy. By increasing the condition value, DT could obtain greater returns than the maximum return in the offline dataset. However, the RCSL framework does not tap into trajectory stitching, i.e., combining sub-trajectories of multiple sub-optimal trajectories to obtain an optimal trajectory. In this paper, the authors combine Q-learning and DT. The estimated Q-values are used to relabel the return-to-gos in the training data.

They borrowed ideas from VQGAN and DALL-E to map raw image pixels to a much smaller amount of image tokens, which are used as the input to autoregressive transformers. After training the transformer world model, the RL agents then learns exclusively from the model imaginations.

Issues of transformers in stochastic environment. The proposed method learns to cluster trajectories and conditions on average cluster returns.  

--------

### Hierarchical Decision Transformer

**arXiv** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10447)  

The original DT highly depends on a carefully chosen return-to-go as the initial input to condition on. To address this challenge, this work proposed to predict subgoals (or options) to replace the return-to-go. Two transformers are trained together while one is used for predicting the subgoals and the the other one is used to predict actions conditioned on the subgoals. Through experiments on D4RL, the authors show that this hierarchical approach can outperform the original DT, especially in tasks that invovle long episodes.

### When does return-conditioned supervised learning work for offline reinforcement learning?  

**arXiv** [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01079)

Focusing on offline reinforcement learning, the authors provide a study on the capabilities and limitations of return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL). The authors found that RCSL requires assumptions stronger than the dynamic programming to return optimal policies. Specifically, the authors pointed out that RCSL requires nearly deterministic dynamics and proper condition values. The authors claim that RCSL alone is unlikely to be a general solution for offline RL problems. However, it may perform well with high quality behavior data.
